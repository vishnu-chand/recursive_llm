# recursive_llm
Implementation of Recursive Language Models (RLMs) based on arXiv:2512.24601. Enables processing of arbitrarily long prompts by treating context as an external environment. The LLM uses a Python REPL to decompose inputs and recursively call itself, achieving inference-time scaling beyond fixed context windows.
